THE BSD LICENSE EXPLAINED
The BSD license in layman's terms.

'Free software' in CoinLQ terms does mean free and open source. Not all our software is free, but what is free you won't ever have to pay for and its source code will be included and unlocked.

Our free software will be covered by a BSD license. But why a license when it's free? The BSD license is one of the most unrestrictive licenses out there, and we use it mainly to disclaim our responsibility for that software which it covers. So you may use it for whatever you want, but we won't take any responsibility if it blows up on you. It by all probability won't blow up on you (we use this software ourselves), but if it does we won't take responsibility for your losses. We certainly would be glad to hear about any problems you might have run into though, so we can fix those issues.

The BSD license we typically use is the BSD 2-clause license (the actual license included with the software could differ, so please check it), and the wording of that is this:
